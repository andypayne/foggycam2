A tool to capture Nest video streams locally or to the Azure cloud, even for users without a Nest subscription. The current release is tested on macOS. Windows and Linux adaptations coming soon (minor tweaks required).

>**NOTE:** Audio recording is currently not supported.

>**NOTE:** Camera labels will be used for directory name if available! 


**If you want to generate video**, you will need to [download `ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and place it in the `tools` folder, in the script root directory.

Alternatively, if you are on Linux, you can install `ffmpeg` with the help of the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

On macOS, you can install `ffmpeg` through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
brew install ffmpeg
```

## How To Start

Make sure you install the requirements for the project, by `cd`-ing in the folder with the project, and running:

```
pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Run `python foggycam2.py` after you configured the settings above. Exit by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
