## How To Start with Docker

Change directory into project
```
cd foggycam2
```

Build Docker image
```
docker build -t foggycam2:latest .
```

Start Docker container
```
docker run -d --name foggcam2 \
    -v [/full/path/to/capture/location]:/usr/local/app/capture/ \
    -v [/full/path/to/your/config/file/config.json]:/usr/local/config.json foggycam2:latest
```
Be sure to replace above the path to recording folder
`[/full/path/to/capture/location]`
and configuration file
`[/full/path/to/your/config/file/config.json]`

## How To Start locally
**`ffmpeg` is required generate video**, [download `ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and place it in the `tools` folder, in the script root directory.
**ImageMagic is required to apply timestamp on images** [download ImageMagic](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php) `tools` folder not supported in this case.

Alternatively, if you are on Linux, you can install `ffmpeg` with the help of the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

On macOS, you can install `ffmpeg` through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
brew install ffmpeg
```

Change directory into project
```
cd foggycam2
```

```
pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Run `python foggycam2.py` after you configured the settings above. Exit by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
